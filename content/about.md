## **Work Experience**

#### **DYNI, LIS Laboratory, France** — **Computer Vision Intern and Research Assistant (06/2023 - 07/2024)**

- Researched and evaluated the fundamentals of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) techniques.
- Explored the specific challenges and considerations involved in applying NeRF techniques to underwater
  environments.
- Conducted experiments to assess the performance and suitability of four distinct NeRF techniques.
- Analyzed the results obtained from each NeRF technique in terms of their effectiveness and limitations.

<br/>

#### **Solina Group, Nigeria** — **Research Analyst (04/2019 - 12/2021)**

- Developed and evaluated 5 machine learning models for image-based immunization record analysis
  to effectively streamline the data analysis processes
- Conducted research on statistical and machine learning models for anomaly detection in immunization
  data. These models which were developed to track deviations in immunization access and delivery plans
  subsequently improved the immunization rate in Kaduna state by 5%.
- Developed three visualization tools to track weekly, monthly, and annual immunization coverage and
  vaccine utilization across municipal, state, and national levels. These tools also leverage historical data
  for predictive analytics, enhancing decision-making capabilities
